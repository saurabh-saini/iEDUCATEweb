            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
                knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
                storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
                educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
                settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
                considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.Although there are private
                schools in India, they are highly regulated in terms of what they can teach, in what form they can
                operate (must be a non-profit to run any accredited educational institution) and all other aspects of
                operation. Hence, the differentiation of government schools and private schools can be misleading.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.


                Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe. The city of
                Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
                of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European
                civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.

                In China, Confucius (551–479 BCE), of the State of Lu, was the country's most influential ancient
                philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like
                Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt
                his ideals for good governance, but his Analects were written down by followers and have continued to
                influence education in East Asia into the modern era.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The central board and most of the state boards uniformly follow the
                "10+2" pattern of education.3 In this pattern, study of 10 years is done in schools and 2 years in
                Junior colleges (Mumbai, Maharashtra),44 and then 3 years of study for a bachelor's degree for college.
                The first 10 years is further subdivided into 4 years of primary education, 6 years of High School
                followed by 2 years of Junior colleges.5 This pattern originated from the recommendation of the
                Education Commission of 1964–66.The primary education in India is divided into two parts, namely Lower
                Primary (Class I-IV) and Upper Primary (Middle school, Class V-VIII). The Indian government lays
                emphasis on primary education (Class I-VIII) also referred to as elementary education, to children aged
                6 to 14 years old. Because education laws are given by the states, duration of primary school visit
                alters between the Indian states. The Indian government has also banned child labour in order to ensure
                that the children do not enter unsafe working conditions. However, both free education and the ban on
                child labour are difficult to enforce due to economic disparity and social conditions. 80% of all
                recognised schools at the elementary stage are government run or supported, making it the largest
                provider of education in the country.
